📝 Detailed To-Do List for Smarter Medical RAG Chatbot


---

🔄 Retrieval (Get the right info every time)

[ ] Hierarchical Retrieval

Store both chapter/section embeddings and chunk embeddings.

Retrieval pipeline: first find the right chapter → section, then refine at chunk-level.

✅ Benefit: Preserves context for physiology flows, drug protocols, tables.


[ ] Hybrid Search (Dense + Sparse)

Add BM25 (via whoosh or Elasticsearch) alongside FAISS embeddings.

Merge results → rerank.

✅ Benefit: Captures rare terms like “ACE inhibitor cough” that embeddings may miss.


[ ] Context Weighting

Tag chunks (summary, glossary, tables).

Give them higher retrieval weight.

✅ Benefit: Medical students often rely on summaries for exams.


[ ] Cross-Encoder Reranker

Use models like ms-marco-MiniLM or a biomedical reranker.

After FAISS returns 30–50 candidates, rerank top 5–10 for precision.

✅ Benefit: Ensures the most semantically correct chunk is used.




---

🧠 Generation (Produce intelligent, exam-ready answers)

[ ] Intent Detection

Classify queries: definition, explanation, compare, steps, contraindications, exam question.

Use a lightweight classifier or regex-based heuristics.

✅ Benefit: Tailors answers to what students actually need.


[ ] Progressive Disclosure

Output a short summary first.

Add “Expand → Detailed Explanation” option.

✅ Benefit: Helps quick revision, but allows deep dive when needed.


[ ] Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Internal reasoning template:

1. Extract facts from sources.


2. Organize logically (definition → mechanism → clinical use → side effects).


3. Generate structured final answer.



✅ Benefit: Reduces hallucinations, keeps answers structured.


[ ] Quiz Generation Mode

After each answer, generate:

3 MCQs (with correct + incorrect options).

Flashcards (Q/A format).

Export to Anki JSON.


✅ Benefit: Active recall → stronger retention for students.


[ ] Multimodal Support (Future)

OCR diagrams, flowcharts, and tables.

Reference them in answers: “See Fig 12.3 for Cardiac Cycle.”

✅ Benefit: Medicine is highly visual → must support non-textual info.

🎓 Pedagogy (Student-focused learning assistant)

[ ] Exam Lens Mode

Special prompt style → concise bullets, keywords bolded.

Example:

“Beta blockers: ↓ HR, ↓ BP, SE: fatigue, bradycardia, asthma contraindication.”


✅ Benefit: Mimics exam notes, high-yield for students.


[ ] Cross-Referencing

After each answer, suggest related topics.

Example: “You asked about Beta Blockers → See also: Calcium Channel Blockers, Heart Failure Mgmt.”

✅ Benefit: Encourages connected learning.


[ ] Self-Quiz Section

Each answer ends with 3–5 practice Qs.

Format: MCQ, True/False, Fill-in-the-blank.

✅ Benefit: Combines passive reading + active recall.


[ ] Source Transparency

Always cite: “Source: Chapter 5, Page 142 (Harrison’s Internal Medicine)”.

If info is weak: “Insufficient details found. Check Ch. 5 for full treatment protocol.”

✅ Benefit: Builds trust, prevents misinformation.


[ ] Study Session Memory

Maintain short-term memory per session.

Example:

Q1: “What are beta blockers?”

Q2: “Compare with calcium channel blockers.”

Bot should connect them automatically.


✅ Benefit: Mimics tutor-like continuity.

🛠 Technical Enhancements (Performance & Accuracy)

[ ] Biomedical Embeddings

Replace general embeddings with BioBERT / PubMedBERT / SapBERT.

✅ Benefit: Better understanding of medical terminology, drug classes, anatomy.


[ ] LLM Fine-Tuning with Textbook QA Pairs

Create dataset: (Question → Textbook Answer).

Fine-tune or LoRA on a 7B LLM (e.g., LLaMA-3, Qwen-Med).

✅ Benefit: Improves factual correctness + exam-style responses.


[ ] Optimize Chunking Strategy

Current: 500–800 tokens with overlap.

Test adaptive chunking (split by section headings, lists, tables).

✅ Benefit: Prevents broken context (e.g., drug contraindications split).


[ ] Query Logging + Feedback Loop

Store user Q → retrieved docs → final answer.

Allow students to rate answers (helpful/not helpful).

✅ Benefit: Build dataset for continuous fine-tuning.
